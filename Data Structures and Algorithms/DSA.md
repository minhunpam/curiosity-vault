## Greedy Algorithm
### What is a Greedy Algorithm?
- a problem-solving approach where, at each step, you make the choice that looks best **at the moment** (“locally optimal”) with the hope that these local choices will lead to the **global optimal solution**

### Properties of problems that suit Greedy Algorithm
1. **Greedy Choice Property**: 
	- The optimal solution can be constructed by making the ****best local choice**** at each step
2. **Optimal Substructure:**
	- The optimal solution to the problem contains the optimal solutions to its subproblems
