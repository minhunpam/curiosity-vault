## `ResponseEntity<T>`
- **represents the whole HTTP response: 
	- Status code 
	- Header
	- Body
	--> use it to fully configure the HTTP Response
-  We use `ResponseEntity`, because it gives complete control over your HTTP response, whereas returning a plain object (or using `@ResponseStatus`) only lets you control the **body** and sometimes the **status**, but not **headers** or dynamic conditions

### When should we use `ResponseEntity`?
1. You need to set a custom status code
2. You want to include custom headers
3. You want dynamic control over response

But when controller endpoints simply return JSON and uses standard success semantics, no need to use `ResponseEntity`, because we have Jackson be responsible for that already
