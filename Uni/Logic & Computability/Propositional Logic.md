## Syntax & Semantics
- **Syntax** of logical language: 
	- set of symbols
	- rules for combining symbols
	to form formulas of the language

- **Semantics** of logic:
	- provides ***meaning***
	- In propositional logic, the meaning is given by the **truth values**
		- $\top$ : true
		- $\bot$: false
	- The semantics of propositional logic assigns $\top$ and $\bot$ to formulas

### Syntax of Propositional Logic
- defines symbols and rules to form formulas in propositional logic
#### Symbols
- Truth symbols ($\top$ and $\bot$)
- Propositional variable symbols (lowercase character)
- Logical operators (logical connectors, Boolean connectors)
	- Conjunction:
	- Dis
