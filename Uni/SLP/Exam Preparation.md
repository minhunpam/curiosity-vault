- global arrays initialized with 0s
- `static` declared within the scope of a function
- deadlock:
	- the thread holds a mutex and is mutex in a never-ending while loop so the mutex is never unlocked, while other threads might want acquire the mutex
- Make proper assumptions to be able to show the race condition
