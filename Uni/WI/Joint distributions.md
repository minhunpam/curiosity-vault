## Covariance
- The **convariance** between X and Y is defined as:
$$
Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - EX)(Y - EY)] = E[XY] - (EX)(EY)
$$
- The convariance between $X$ and $Y$ indicates how the values of $X$ and $Y$ move relative to each other
	- If large values of $X$ tend to happen with large values of $Y$, then $(X - EX)(Y - EY)$ is positive on average -> **The convariance is positive <=> $X$ and $Y$ are positively correlated**
	- If large values of $X$ tend to be small with when $Y$ is large, then $(X - EX)(Y - EY)$ is negative on average -> **The convariance is positive <=> $X$ and $Y$ are negatively correlated**
