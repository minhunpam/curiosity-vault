## What is `.bc` file when compiling with `Clang`?
- `.bc` = LLVM Bitcode file - an intermediate representation of your program used by the **LLVM** compiler infrastructure
- LLVM compiles: C/C++ source --> **LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR)**
- `.bc` file is compiled, binary version of that IR
- is not machine code yet
