- `SFML` = Simple and Fast Multimedia Library

## What is `sf` inside the `SFML` 
- is a namespace that groups related classes, functions and objects to avoid name conflicts
- So when you write:
```
sf::Vector2f position(100.f, 200.f);
```
This could be understood:
- Use the `Vector2f` class that is defined inside the `sf` namespace


## What is `Vector2f` ?
- `Vector2f` = 2D vector of floats with 2 components x and y
- commonly used in SFML to represent:
	- Position --> `shape.setPosition(sf::Vector2f(10.f, 20.f)`
	- Size --> `shape.setSize(sf::Vector2f(80.f, 50.f))`

## What is the difference between `sf::Window` and `sf::RenderWindow`
- `sf::Window`
	- create a window, handle input/ events, control window properties
	- Cannot draw SFML graphics with it
	- Use case: when only needing a window for OpenGL Rendering
- `sf::RenderWindow`
	- inherits all of `sf::Window`'s features + provides functions to draw SMFL graphics
	- supports `draw()` calls for SFML shapes
	- Use case: use this class for most games

## What is `sf::Event` and why do we need that in the main app loop?
- `sf::Event` =
	- a struct in SFML that represents a single event generated by the OS
	- acts as a container to receive information about each event as it happens
	- In the event loop, SFML will fill this variable with data about the next event from the **event queue**


## `localBounds` vs `globalBounds`
- `localBounds` - the rectangle that contains the object in its own local coordinate system (before any transformation)
- `globalBounds` - the rectangle that con

## What is `event.key.code`?
- `event` is an `sf::Event` object
- `event.key` - a struct inside `sf::Event` that holds data about a keyboard event
- `event.key.code` - an enum represents which specific key was pressed or released -> returns `sf::Keyboard::Key` value
