- is declared outside any function
- global variables do not stay limited to a specific function == one can use any given function to access and modify the global variables

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Global Variable

| can be accessed by all the functions present in the program | The value of a global variable can be changed accidentally                                                   |
| Only a one-time declaration                                 | If we use a large number of global variables, then there is a high chance of error generation in the program |
| all the functions are accessing the same data               |                                                                                                              |
