## What is port 8080?
- port number ~ "door number" that our application uses for network communication on the server
- Imagine the server is a building with many doors and  Each *Port* is like a door with a number on it. When clients want to visit the server, they need to know which door to use
- Port 80 - traditional door for HTTP web traffic
	- already in use by another web server
	- on many computers, only admin users can use ports below 1024 (like port 80)
- Port 8080 - higher port number -> easier and safer to develop and test
