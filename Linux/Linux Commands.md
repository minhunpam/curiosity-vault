## Listing
```bash
ls -la
```
- `-la`:
	- **`-l`** → long listing format.  
    Instead of just showing filenames, it shows details like permissions, owner, group, size, and modification time.
	- **`-a`** → show _all_ files, including hidden ones (those starting with `.`).

## Displaying
```bash
df -h
```
- `df` - **"disk filesystem"** - report how much disk space is used and available on all mounted filesystems
